        <p>My name is Madison and I really like art. I do digital art, drawing, and painting, and I also like to sew and crochet.</p>
        <p>I first started doing big art projects when I was in ninth grade, and I've been hooked ever since. I love the feeling</p>
        <p>of creating something that others can enjoy. Most recently, I made a large unicorn stuffed animal for my little sister's</p>
        <p>seventh birthday. She really liked it, and that's what brings me the most joy in creating things.</p>
